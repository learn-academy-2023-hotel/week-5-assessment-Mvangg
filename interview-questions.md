# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: TDD stands for Test Driven Development which is a development process in writing a test before actual coding. The steps of TDD are writing the test, writing the code, running the code to pass, and refactoring the code to make it more clean.

Researched answer: The TDD is a workflow that follows a structured process when creating a software. You begin by writing the test that is designed to explain what you want the code to do. This typically comes out a failed test because the code has yet to be defined or exist. Following the failed test, you write the code that will make the test pass. Usually it's as minimalistic as possible only for the sole purpose of having the test pass. Next you run the test to ensure it passes. Once passed, you can refactor the recently written passed test to ensure its more clean and more efficient. At this moment, it's suggested to run the test again to ensure it still passes. Then a cycle of repeat for each change and new test. 

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database is a database that stores and manages data in a table format. Very similar to how an excel spreadsheet will look with columns and rows. PostgreSQL is an example of a relationship database.

Researched answer: A relational database is a type of database management system (DBMS) that stores and maanges data in a structured manner. The data are organized in a table with rows and columns and are similar with each other obtaining primary keys. Some databases used out there are MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite. There are many types of databases out there but their use depends on the needs of developers. 

3. Why is an ORM?

Your answer: ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. I'm unsure how to answer this question to satisfaction thus will do some research to have a better provided answer.

Researched answer: ORM - Object Relational Mapping, is a program technique and tool that maes it easier to interact etween relationship database and an application that is written in an object oriented programming language. ORM allows developers to work with objects and classes in their code instead of writing in SQL which makes it more understandable. Developers can utilize a programming language thats most familiar to them and won't have to worry about writing SQL queries because ORM translate it into SQL. Essentially, it's a translator between developer's codes and the database. 

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: Inheritance in JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance. Objects inherits properties and methods from other objects using the prototype property. In JavaScript, an object can only inherit from one other object but it is possible to inherit from another object and that object may inherit from another as well. In Ruby, inheritance uses class in a hierachical structure. Ruby supports multiple inheritance but relies on class definitions. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model Validation is a important part of software development. It's applied to relational databases and object relationsional mapping frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and are a set of rules/conditions to data models or objects before they're saved onto databases. It's purpose is to help maintain consistenacy and integrity of data in the databases, preventing error or incompletion of data going into databases, contributing in overall quality of data being stored and accurate, and also improving data security. 

2. Params: Params is short for parameters which is a placeholder that is used in codes. Allowing developers to pass data into a set of code which in turn can be used in different types of ways that is customizable and abstract. It allows developers to take in external data and use them in different behaviors of functions or methods, which in turn can manipulate the inputted data depending on what the developer is looking for. 

3. API: API stands for Application Programming Interface. API is a tool that allows different types of applications to communicate with each other. This alows an integration that allows data to be shared and has a broad range of purpose that includes Data Accessing - being able to access and retrieve data from remote servers and databases, Functionality Extension - being able to enhance applications with features and servies from other providers, Automation - allowing software systems to communicate with each other without having to intervene, Third-Party Integrations - allowing the integration of applications by third-party services, IoT (Internet of Things) - communication through cloud-based services, and Web Development - enables use between frontend and backend of web applications.
